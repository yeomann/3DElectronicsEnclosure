This is a fully parametric, 3D-printable electronics enclosure designed to house small projects, PCBs, or Arduino/Raspberry Pi setups. It features a robust box design with optional lid, ventilation, and cable exit slots for easy wiring. The design is fully customizable in OpenSCAD and can be scaled or modified to suit your project requirements.



### Features:

- Adjustable inner cavity dimensions (default: 200 × 80 × 45 mm)
- Solid outer walls and base for stability
- Removable lid with lip for secure fit
- Bottom ventilation slots to improve airflow
- Cable exit slots on all sides for neat wiring
- Optional feet for elevated mounting
- Parametric OpenSCAD design: easily customize wall thickness, lid, vents, and slot sizes
- Designed for 3D printing with minimal supports

### Use Cases:

- Electronics projects (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, etc.)
- Small sensor modules or PCBs
- DIY enclosures for hobby projects
- Prototyping and testing setups

### Printing Recommendations:

- Layer height: 0.2 mm or lower for a clean finish
- Wall thickness: 2 mm (default)
- Supports: only needed for overhangs if you rotate the box
- Material: PLA, PETG, or ABS depending on your application

### Included Files:

- `enclosure.scad` – fully parametric OpenSCAD source
- STL exports ready for slicing
